# Robot-in-a-maze
1st project of object-orientated programming with Python. I wanted to experiment with Python and object-orientation. 
This program defines 2 classes, a robot and an underwater robot.
Robot is defined and can move through the maze or go deeper underwater.
# Robot can move forward, backward, right, left and down
Underwater class made for 3-d representation of robot, but visual doesn't show the 3-d orientation
